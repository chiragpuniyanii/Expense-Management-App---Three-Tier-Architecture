# Three-Tier Expense Management Application
## üöÄ Project Overview
The **Three-Tier Expense Management Application** is designed to help users track and manage their expenses effectively. The application follows a **three-tier architecture** consisting of:

**1) Frontend**: A user-friendly web interface served via Nginx.

**2) Backend**: A Node.js application handling business logic, API requests, and interacting with the database.

**3) Database**: A MySQL database used for storing user expenses and other related data.

This README will guide you through the steps to deploy the **Three-Tier Expense Management Application** on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu.

## üõ† Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu.
- Security groups configured to allow:
    - HTTP (port 80) for web traffic.
    - MySQL (port 3306) for database access.
- Root access (or sudo privileges) on the EC2 instance.

## üì¶ Project Components

**1) Frontend: A simple, responsive user interface served through Nginx.**

**2) Backend: A Node.js API that handles business logic and connects to the MySQL database.**

**3) Database: MySQL for storing user data and expense information.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

**Step 1: Set Up Frontend with Nginx**

*Update the system and install Nginx:*


```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

*Start and enable Nginx to run on boot:*

```
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

*Check Nginx:*

Open your browser and visit http://EC2-PUBLIC-IP/ to verify that Nginx is working.

*Remove default content:*

```
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
```


*Clone the frontend repository:*

```bash
sudo apt install git -y  # Install Git if not already installed
sudo git clone https://github.com/chiragpuniyanii/Expense-frontend.git /var/www/html
```

Verify frontend by visiting http://EC2-PUBLIC-IP/.

*Configure Nginx reverse proxy for the backend:*

Edit the Nginx config file:

```bash

sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/expense.conf
```
Add the following content:


```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <Instance-IP>;

    root /var/www/html/expense-frontend;
    index index.html;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}              
```
Replace <Instance-IP> with the backend server IP address.

*Restart Nginx:*

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```



## Step 2: Install MySQL
*Install MySQL Server:*

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

*Start MySQL and enable it to start at boot:*

```bash

sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

*Setting a root password:*

```bash
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'ExpenseApp@1';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Set the root password to ExpenseApp@1 (or your preferred password).


## Step 3: Set Up Backend (Node.js)

*Install Node.js (version 20):*

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```
*Create a user for the application:*

```bash
sudo useradd expense
```

*Create a directory for the backend application:*

```bash
sudo mkdir /app
sudo chown expense:expense /app
```

*Clone the repository into the /app directory:*

```bash
cd /app
sudo git clone https://github.com/chiragpuniyanii/expense-backend.git
```

*Navigate to the cloned backend directory:*

```bash
cd /app/expense-backend
```

*Install required dependencies:*

```bash
sudo npm install

*Create a Systemd service for the backend:*

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/backend.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini

[Unit]
Description=Backend Service

[Service]
User=expense
Environment=DB_HOST="localhost"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /app/index.js
SyslogIdentifier=backend

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
                                
```

*Reload Systemd, enable, and start the backend service:*

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backend
sudo systemctl start backend
```


## Step 4: Load Database Schema
*Install MySQL client (if not already installed):*

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-client -y
```

*Load the schema into MySQL:*

```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root -pExpenseApp@1 < /app/schema/backend.sql
```

## üìù Recap
- Frontend is served via Nginx.
- Backend is a Node.js service that interacts with the MySQL database.
- MySQL is used for storing user data and expenses.

## üîÑ Troubleshooting
*Nginx Reverse Proxy Not Working: Ensure the backend service is running and accessible by checking Nginx logs:*

```bash
sudo journalctl -u nginx
```

*MySQL Connection Issues: Check the connection details in the backend service (/etc/systemd/system/backend.service) and ensure MySQL is running.*

*Backend Not Starting: Review backend service logs to check for errors:*

```bash
sudo journalctl -u backend
```

## üí° Additional Notes

- Always make sure that MySQL, Node.js, and Nginx are properly configured.

- Use secure passwords for your database and application.

- Regularly check application logs for any errors that may arise during runtime.

## üéâ Conclusion
This README provides detailed instructions for setting up and deploying the Three-Tier Expense Management Application on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance. By following these steps, you will successfully deploy the frontend, backend, and MySQL database for the application.
